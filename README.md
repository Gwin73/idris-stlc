# idris-stlc
Verified typechecker and evaluator for Simply Typed Lamda Calculus (STLC) in Idris inspired by [this blogpost](https://plfa.github.io/Properties/). The evaluator are based on the progress and preservation theorems which are also proved. Load into the Idris REPL with  ```idris .\stlc.idr -p pruviloj ```.
